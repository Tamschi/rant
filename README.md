## Introducing: Rant 4

Rant 4 is a complete redesign and reimplementation of the Rant language, written in Rust. 
It's designed with usability in mind for everyone-- programmers, writers, and everyone in-between!


Rant is basically the opposite of [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression): 
just as a regular expression compares inputs to a pattern, Rant generates matching outputs from a pattern!

## Why Rant?

ðŸ§° **Painless API** <br/> 
Rant's API is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Integrating Rant into your project only takes a few lines of code.

ðŸ’» **Cross-Platform** <br/> 
Write once, run anywhere-- Rant code is fully portable across all supported platforms.

ðŸŽ² **Built with â™¥ for RNG** <br/>
Enjoy a wide array of built-in utilities for generating random numbers, strings, booleans, lists, list subsets, and much more. The internal RNG can be seeded before execution to produce deterministic outputs.

ðŸ”± **Advanced Branching** <br/> 
Fine-tune branching behavior with a multitude of configuration options and branch selection modes for iterative, random, and weighted selection.

ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic Variable System** <br/> 
Inspired by other popular scripting languages, Rant's dynamic variable system ergonomically supports common primitives, collection types, closures, and more.

ðŸ–¨ **Print Semantics** <br/> 
Rant is all about "printing": each lexical scope has an output to add values ("print") to, which then prints itself to the parent output, and so on. 
This lets you easily build strings and collections from multiple parts with minimal code.

ðŸ§¬ **Delightful Combinatorics** <br/> 
Perform nested mappings, filters, zips, combinations, and more with Rant's intuitive piping syntax.

ðŸŽ› **Automatic Formatting** <br/> 
Passively format text output with automatic capitalization, whitespace normalization, and number formatting.

ðŸ§© **Modules** <br/> 
Create libraries of Rant functions and share them between your programs using Rant's simple module system.

ðŸ“š **Rant Standard Library** <br/> 
A comprehensive standard library provides the tools needed to rapidly iterate on your ideas.

## Getting started

### CLI

Rant's CLI can run Rant code from files or the command line.
Install it from Cargo with:

```sh
$ cargo install rant --version 4.0.0-alpha.22 --features cli
```

Then run it:

```sh
$ rant
```

### Library

Add Rant to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rant = "*"
```

You can run a Rant program with just a few lines of code:

```rust
use rant::Rant;
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
  // Create a default Rant context
  let mut rant = Rant::new();

  // Compile a simple program
  let program = rant.compile_quiet(r#"
  [$greet:name] {
    {Hello|Hi|Hey} <name>!
  }
  [greet:world]
  "#)?;

  // Run the program and print the output
  let output = rant.run(&program)?;
  println!("{}", output);

  Ok(())
}
```

## [Examples](./examples/rant/)

This repository contains a directory of example programs written in Rant for you to learn from. Check them out!

## Documentation
