**Rant** is a high-level language for **procedural templating**, providing a diverse and powerful toolset for easily creating dynamic code templates, game dialogue, stories, name generators, test data, and much more.

## WARNING:

**This project is in alpha. Expect to see broken/missing features.**

**While I encourage you to try it out and give feedback, please do not use in production environments until a stable version is released.**

**Features may appear or disappear at any time for any reason. Assume that every alpha release will be breaking.**

## Introducing Rant 4

Rant 4 is a complete redesign and reimplementation from the ground up, written in Rust. 
It's designed around the needs of everyone-- programmers, writers, and everyone in-between!

### Intuitive syntax

Rant is basically the opposite of [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression): 
just as a regular expression compares inputs to a pattern, Rant generates matching outputs from a pattern!

Consider this regex:

```regex
# Matching inputs:
#  - "Hey world!"
#  - "Hi world!"
#  - "Hello world!"

(Hey|Hi|Hello) world!
```

The Rant equivalent is nearly identical:

```rant
{Hey|Hi|Hello} world!

# Possible outputs:
#  - "Hey world!"
#  - "Hi world!"
#  - "Hello world!"
```

## Features

ðŸ§° **Painless API** <br/> Rant's API is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Integrating Rant into your project only takes a few lines of code!

ðŸ’» **Cross-Platform** <br/> Write once, run anywhere-- Rant code is fully portable across all supported platforms.

ðŸ“š **Rant Standard Library** <br/> Rant's comprehensive standard library lets you get more done and iterate rapidly with far less boilerplate than other languages.

ðŸ”± **Advanced Branching** <br/> Fine-tune branching behavior with a multitude of configuration options and branch selection modes, including several iterative and randomized selection modes.

ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic Variable System** <br/> Inspired by other popular languages, Rant's built-in primitive and collection types let you represent whatever data you need.

ðŸ–¨ **Print Semantics** <br/> Every scope has an "output" you can "print" to. Easily build strings and collections without the need for temporary variables.

ðŸ§¬ **Delightful Combinatorics** <br/> Easily perform nested mappings, filters, zips, combinations, and more with Rant's powerful function composition and iteration engine. 

ðŸŽ› **Automatic Formatting** <br/> Passively format text output with automatic capitalization, whitespace normalization, and number formatting.

ðŸ§© **Modules** <br/> Create libraries of Rant functions to easily share between your programs.

ðŸ§¶ **Entanglement** <br/> Synchronize RNG behavior in different parts of your program with a single function call.

## Getting started

### CLI

Rant's CLI can run Rant code from files or the command line.
Install it from Cargo with:

```sh
$ cargo install rant --version 4.0.0-alpha.19 --features cli
```

Then run it:

```sh
$ rant
```

### Library

Add Rant to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rant = "*"
```

You can run a Rant program with just a few lines of code:

```rust
use rant::Rant;
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
  // Create a default Rant context
  let mut rant = Rant::new();

  // Compile a simple program
  let program = rant.compile_quiet(r#"
  [$greet:name] {
    {Hello|Hi|Hey} <name>!
  }
  [greet:world]
  "#)?;

  // Run the program and print the output
  let output = rant.run(&program)?;
  println!("{}", output);

  Ok(())
}
```

## Documentation
